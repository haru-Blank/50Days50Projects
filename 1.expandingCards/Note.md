# Expanding Demos

## Problem

- Display 5 images
- only 1 image takes full width and other images are small in capsule form vertically
- each images have footer image which is displayed when image takes full width
- the clicked image get full width

## Plan

- use flex box to display images 
- all images have flex: 1, when image is clicked, it will be flex: 5
- add event listener to images and when clicked, add full image class
- make an array of links of images with title, these will be rendered to html using js
